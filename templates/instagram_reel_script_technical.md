# Instagram Reel Script: Technical Architecture of Startup News Content Creator

## HOOK
üë®‚Äçüíª Want to see how I built a Python system that automatically generates multi-language content for 5 social platforms? Let me show you in 60 seconds!

## MAIN PART
This modular Python system uses:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Web scraping with BeautifulSoup to collect startup news from MENABytes
2Ô∏è‚É£ NLP algorithms to select the most relevant articles based on content quality and topic
3Ô∏è‚É£ OpenAI API integration with fallback to template-based generation when API is unavailable
4Ô∏è‚É£ Style configuration system for customizable content generation
5Ô∏è‚É£ Organized file structure with article-based folders containing content in multiple languages

The architecture follows a pipeline pattern:
- Scraper ‚Üí Data Processing ‚Üí Content Generation ‚Üí Output Organization

Each component can run independently or as part of the automated workflow using Python's schedule library.

The system handles error cases gracefully and maintains detailed logs for each article processed.

## CONCLUSION
This architecture saves 10+ hours of content creation weekly. Want the GitHub repo? Drop "CODE" in comments!

## VISUAL IDEAS
- Start with a split screen showing code on one side and generated content on the other
- Show a diagram of the system architecture with animated data flow
- Display terminal with running code and real-time output
- Show the file structure with folders being created for each article
- Demonstrate the difference between AI-generated and template-based content
- End with before/after comparison of manual vs. automated workflow
